# Stock Analysis VBA Code 

## Overview & Purpose 

Refactor code and have the ability to use all syntax involved with running code. Execute (for) loops, Tickers, etc through excel. 
Ability to work with macros and provide tangilble data with a more efficient way of runnnig code through excel. Ability to present color formating 
and conditionals along with its own statements. Provide investing data for client within 
years 2017 - 2018 and some for stock "DQ". After further inspection of data, coding efficiency percentage lowered.
Refactoring code gave an equal percentage of results but was much more efficient. 


## Results 
  For year 2017 we can see that a larger amount of total dialy volume, after looping through arrays and allowing the code to provide me with total 
  "Ticker" Volume i was able to see and script data through stock data.

  Prior to entering code for "Ticker Index" we were unable to see the amount of total dialy volume that was actually un-efficient. Running code
  using the tikcer index volume to increase as follows using if then statements. After fully applying code to the rest of the refactored code we were able to compare both 
  2017 and 2018 outcomes to provide to our Client.

# Advantages and Disadvanteges to refactoring code 

  Some of the advantages to refactoring are it allows far better organization to the code, faster process times, 
  and giving you the ability to keep code quick and presentable will benefit with consumers. 
  A lot of the time refacorting does not work when large files need to be structured and coded it won't engage, 
  you may also run into issues if the formatting is not correct when running the code. 
  So if the opportunity presents itself and if the code is compatible refactoring may be an easier quicker choice.
  
  
  
  # How do these Pros & Cons apply to refactoring
 
 As I observed the data the original script was displaying a .30% efficiency drop compared to it being refactored.
  Pros to this is a slight increase in rate of efficiency and ease of formatting. Extendibility toward other software works better with vba when debugging 
  
  
  Improper refactoring will introduce new possible bugs and issues. Code is not as neat, and could get overwelming. Slow over all efficiency. Coordinating 
  and establishing good readable data for consumer may be harder to display.
